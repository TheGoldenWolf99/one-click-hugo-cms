Who is this man. [Why is his picture here](/wdwdw). The CMS that built this template website is really into coffee. I just want to figure out how to do cool stuff, but I don't really know what to add yet, and how much I need to change outside of the CMS by editing the git repo. But that means I need to learn markdown, and also like github and stuff.

So I guess this is where I'll probably put my resume, and like post things to help me learn. It would make sense to practice doing write-ups for TryHackMe, to make me learn how that stuff works. And I can also add stuff for C/C++ programs I write.

I will edit this more later, here is more coffee information, that I have not verified, so it could be just a bunch of lies.
## The little secrets of Chemex brewing

The Chemex Coffeemaker consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing compound found in coffee oils. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:

1. Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.
2. Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.
3. Never skip preheating the glass.
4. Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.

The most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the conical glass.

For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive feature of its appearance.
